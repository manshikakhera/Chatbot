Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves combining retrieval techniques with generation models to provide more accurate and context-aware responses. Here's a refined version emphasizing RAG:

         Developed RAG-based data ingestion pipelines using LangChain for text, HTML, and PDF formats.
         Implemented RAG with FAISS for semantic search and GPT4AllEmbeddings for generating relevant responses.
         Extracted web and PDF content using WebBaseLoader and PyPDFLoader.
         Enhanced retrieval and generation accuracy by chunking documents with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
